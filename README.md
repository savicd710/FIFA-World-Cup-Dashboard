# FIFA World Cup Dashboard

### Premise

We set out to create a dashboard that would display a number of graphs and statistics on past Fifa World Cup Series. These ranged from the 1994 World Cup, up until the qualifying games of 2022. Data was taken both from a data set on Kaggle.com, as well as scraped data from Wikipedia
